PoC-JS
======

This is a JavaScript port of the game 
"Prelude of the Chambered" by Markus "notch" Persson.

Currently this is already working in current versions of Firefox,
Chrome/Chromium and likely also Safari (and other WebKit browsers). Support for
Opera and Internet Explorer 9+ is planned.

The game looks best on Firefox as its canvas scaling can be made to _not_ use
anti-aliasing. WebKit-based browsers produce a really squishy scale.

Performance is acceptable although there surely are laggy moments.

Some bugs are still to fix.

Lessons learned
----------------

- CanvasContext.drawImage takes the PNG alpha channel into account.
  The original pixel values are therefore not identical to
  CanvasContext.getImageData(...).data

- doing level design as graphics may be a good idea, storing level meta data
  in the alpha channel may be not

- having no Integer type sucks

- having only function level scope sucks (no lexical scope? seriously?)

- having the canvas engine scale an image is much faster than doing it
  in JS (oh, really?)

- all browsers use anti-aliasing when scaling by default.
  Only Firefox can be told with

    CanvasContext.mozImageSmoothingEnabled = false

  to have a nice ruff, blocky scale

- play testing a permadeath game that has no saves is annoying
